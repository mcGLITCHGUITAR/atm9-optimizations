# Xmx and Xms set the maximum and minimum RAM usage, respectively.
# They can take any number, followed by an M or a G.
# M means Megabyte, G means Gigabyte.
# For example, to set the maximum to 3GB: -Xmx3G
# To set the minimum to 2.5GB: -Xms2500M
# Usually you want to allocate as much ram as possible (not over half your ram if it's not a dedicated server, and if it is leave 1-2 gigabytes for the system on linux and 3-4 for windows)

# Tells the JVM that it is definitely a server
-server

# Min (Xms) and max (Xmx) RAM. Reducing the difference between the two can reduce the number of memory allocations and therefore time spent not running the server
-Xms14G
-Xmx21G
